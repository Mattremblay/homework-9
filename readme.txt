This project was to plot out 2 sets of variables and then to cluster them into 3 sets of colour.
the data points had to be visually be looked over in order to choose manually 3 sets of points to cluster around.
some data looked to be outliers and could have easily fallen into different clusters based on which origin points were chosen. 
there could be a more specific algorythm utilized that could factor distances from origin points that could take out the manual choosing or origins and this will have to be worked on.
the present clustering was created by using distances from evaluating the points and calculating the distances to the 3 points in a pytagorian equation
the program than choose the cluster it belong to by associating it to a class  judged on the shortest distance.
